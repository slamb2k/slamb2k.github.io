# Desktop Bridge Link Roundup

I've been working pretty seriously with the Desktop Bridge (Project Centennial) to help some of our partners get their Win32 applications into the Windows Store. As a bi-product of this I have come across a whole host of valuable resources on what the bridge is all about and how to use it in different scenarios.
[Desktop Bridge – The bridge between desktop apps and the Universal Windows Platform](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/appconsult/2016/10/13/desktop-bridge-the-bridge-between-win32-apps-and-the-universal-windows-platform/) - A general overview of the desktop bridge and why it's so cool. [Desktop Bridge – Converting an installer with Desktop App Converter](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/appconsult/2016/10/17/desktop-bridge-converting-an-installer/) - Some guidance on the simplest strategy for converting desktop applications using the Desktop App Converter tool. [Desktop Bridge – Manually converting a desktop application](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/appconsult/2016/10/28/desktop-bridge-manually-converting-a-desktop-application/) - How to convert any bag of files (no installer required) to a Windows Store app. [Using the updated Desktop App Converter to manually convert a desktop application](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/appconsult/2017/03/09/using-the-updated-desktop-app-converter-to-manually-convert-a-desktop-application/) -Now the Desktop App Converter makes manual conversion easier by allowing you to point at a directory rather than an installer.

[Desktop Bridge (aka Project Centennial) samples](https://github.com/qmatteoq/DesktopBridge) - Some nice examples of features that can be leveraged from applications converted using the Desktop Bridge.
