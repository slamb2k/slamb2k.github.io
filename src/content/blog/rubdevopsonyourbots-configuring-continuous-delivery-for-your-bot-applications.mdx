# #RubDevOpsOnYourBots - Configuring continuous delivery for your Bot Applications.

I have been involved in a Conversation as a Platform (CaaP) hack this week and the first thing that seemed to be valuable to the teams was to sort out a CI/CD pipeline for their projects. With the introduction of the _**Continuous Delivery Tools for Visual Studio**_ from the marketplace this is actually surprisingly easy to do. The tool will perform the following activities:

1.  Create an App Service in your Azure subscription.
2.  Create a CI build for the bot.
3.  Create a CD release to the App Service.

With that in place, the teams could then hack away together with all of their changes going straight to a live app service that they could immediately visualise their updates with. Let's take a look...

## What do I need?

I'm glad you ask. We need a few cogs to make this machine run:

### Bot Application Template

First hit the [Bot Framework SDK page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bot-framework/resources-tools-downloads) and grab the SDK but most importantly the [Bot template for Visual Studio](http://aka.ms/bf-bc-vstemplate). You're going to need to put the template in your templates folder so you can create it in Visual Studio.
For more information on how to do this check out this [documentation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/y3kkate1.aspx). Basically we need to copy the _**Bot Application.zip**_ file we downloaded to the following directory: _**My Documents\\Visual Studio 2017\\Templates\\ProjectTemplates\\Visual C#**_ Now you'll be able to create a Bot Application within Visual Studio 2017.

### Continuous Delivery Extension

Next hit up the marketplace and install the [Continuous Delivery](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VSIDEDevOpsMSFT.ContinuousDeliveryToolsforVisualStudio) extension. You will need to restart Visual Studio after you do this.

### Visual Studio Team Services

Hopefully you're already using the one product on the planet that can satisfy all of your ALM needs but if you're not, go to [visualstudio.com](https://www.visualstudio.com/) and then click on the _**"get started for free"**_ button to create your very own instance. Remember, it's free for up to five users and fully functional for those five lucky souls.
![Rubdevopsonyourbots Configuring Continuous Delivery For Your Bot Applications](/images/blog/rubdevopsonyourbots-configuring-continuous-delivery-for-your-bot-applications-1758985195929-0.png) Once you have created the bot application, right click on the _**solution**_ and click the _**Configure Continuous Delivery**_ menu item: ![Rubdevopsonyourbots Configuring Continuous Delivery For Your Bot Applications](/images/blog/rubdevopsonyourbots-configuring-continuous-delivery-for-your-bot-applications-1758985196176-1.png) As your code isn't in source control you will get this friendly instruction to do so: ![Rubdevopsonyourbots Configuring Continuous Delivery For Your Bot Applications](/images/blog/rubdevopsonyourbots-configuring-continuous-delivery-for-your-bot-applications-1758985196235-2.png) From here you can simply click on the _**Add this project to source control**_ link and choose whether you want to push the code to VSTS Git (Unlimited private repos!!!) or Github. I was using Github in my hack so I'll assume we used that from here on.
After we have pushed we simply click the same _**Configure Continuous Delivery**_ link and we're presented with a dialog to enter our details into: ![Rubdevopsonyourbots Configuring Continuous Delivery For Your Bot Applications](/images/blog/rubdevopsonyourbots-configuring-continuous-delivery-for-your-bot-applications-1758985196282-3.png) You'll need to create a personal access token (PAT) on Github so do that and be sure to grant it the _**repo**_ and _**notifications**_ scopes. ![Rubdevopsonyourbots Configuring Continuous Delivery For Your Bot Applications](/images/blog/rubdevopsonyourbots-configuring-continuous-delivery-for-your-bot-applications-1758985196331-4.png) Finally enter in the details for your VSTS instance and your Azure subscription and then hit OK. Buckle up for the magic... It's in the output window. :-) ![Rubdevopsonyourbots Configuring Continuous Delivery For Your Bot Applications](/images/blog/rubdevopsonyourbots-configuring-continuous-delivery-for-your-bot-applications-1758985196383-5.png) Once this is complete it will actually kick off the build and the deployment automatically but if you want to have a look, open VSTS and delve into the Build and Release sections to see the inner workings of your pipeline. \ The end result is a bot application that is all ready to rock on Azure.
Now the team can happily hack away knowing that all of their changes are straight up to a place where they see the results immediately. It's all about feedback loops!!! ![Rubdevopsonyourbots Configuring Continuous Delivery For Your Bot Applications](/images/blog/rubdevopsonyourbots-configuring-continuous-delivery-for-your-bot-applications-1758894643871.

# Happy hacking!!!
