# Things I Learned Today #3 - Moving Azure boxes to a new virtual network

While playing around with Power BI in the cloud I ran into some difficulties with authenticating with on-premise SQL Server Analysis Services. I found a great post showing how to get around this for a demo but it first involved connecting my box running the cube to an existing AD. To do this I had to get my existing VM on another virtual network. Apparently this isn't just setting some magic configuration setting but it can be pulled off with a simple lift and shift operation. ThisÂ (http://blogs.technet.com/b/canitpro/archive/2014/06/17/step-by-step-move-a-vm-to-a-different-vnet-on-azure.aspx) shows you how to make it happen... Next I'll post the details of how to trick AD into playing nice with Power BI.
