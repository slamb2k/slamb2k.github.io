# Welcome to MDX-Powered Blog

This blog has been migrated to use **MDX** - a powerful markup format that lets you write JSX directly in your markdown files.

## What is MDX?

MDX is an extension of Markdown that allows you to use JSX components directly within your content. This means you can:

- Write standard markdown as usual
- Import and use React components
- Create interactive content
- Maintain all content in a single file

## Benefits of MDX

### 1. Component Integration

You can embed React components directly in your content, making it interactive and dynamic.

### 2. Frontmatter Support

Each MDX file includes frontmatter for metadata:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Post Title"
date: "2025-01-26"
tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
---
```

### 3. Better Developer Experience

- Single file for content and metadata
- Type-safe component usage
- Hot module reloading during development
- Better syntax highlighting in editors

## Code Examples

Here's how you might include code in your MDX posts:

```typescript
interface BlogPost {
  title: string;
  date: string;
  excerpt: string;
  tags: string[];
}
```
