# "Find was stopped in progress" while performing search in Visual Studio

This issue has been plaguing me for some time and I usually just work around it but today I finally found a fix. It has happened in Visual Studio 2010, 2013 and today it started occurring in 2013 RC. I found a fix in this [Microsoft Connect thread](http://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/718217/find-was-stopped-in-progress-while-performing-search-in-visual-studio) and thought I would blog it as a few of the other guys at work had also encountered it from time to time. I don’t know if this is the “official” fix but the following worked for me: 1. Find in Files for any search string. 2. As soon as it starts searching spam Ctrl – Scroll Lock. 3.
