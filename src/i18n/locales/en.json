    "subtitle": "Principal AI/Software Engineer | GenAI/RAG, LLMOps, SRE",
    "tagline": "I build production GenAI platforms on Microsoft Azure and bring DevOps leadership from the ground up.",
    "heading": "About",
    "paragraph1": "I build production GenAI platforms on Microsoft Azure and bring DevOps leadership from the ground up. Recently, I focused on LLM platform engineering inside Microsoft Azure Core, where I delivered AI systems with full LLMOps/MLOps rigorâ€”CI/CD, evaluation pipelines, guardrails, observability, and cost/latency governance.",
    "paragraph2": "Azure Core: I engineered a platform that applied Azure OpenAI + agentic retrieval to analyse internal Microsoft product codebases. The goal: automatically surface security, performance, and best-practice risks before rollout. This strengthened governance and reduced incidents from problematic deployments. With code contexts spanning thousands of lines, I designed token-aware batching, caching, and aggregation strategies that made multi-chunk evaluation feasible and cost-effective. I embedded automatic + human-in-the-loop eval gates, enabling multiple developers to iterate safely on prompt designs without regressions.",
    "paragraph3": "Global Partner Solutions (CSA): Before Azure Core, I partnered with enterprises and ISVs to modernise workloads onto Azure (AKS, App Services, Front Door, Private Link) and accelerate GenAI adoption (Databricks, MLflow, Semantic Kernel). I ran workshops, design reviews, and enablement that reduced prototype-to-production cycles from months to weeks.",
    "paragraph4": "Developer Experience & OpenHack: Earlier at Microsoft, I served as Technical Evangelist and later DevOps OpenHack Tech Lead. I led global OpenHacks in Melbourne, Sydney (with Satya Nadella's ANZ visit), Canberra, Las Vegas (Inspire/Ready), and Seattle (TechReady), directing coach teams and mentoring hundreds of engineers. Across these events, I achieved near-perfect satisfaction scores (~95%+) while enabling partners like ANZ, Deloitte, EY, KPMG, Accenture, PwC, Seek, and MYOB.",
    "paragraph5": "DevOps pedigree: My roots are in Fred IT Group, where I was Tech Architect/DevOps Lead for regulated healthcare platforms, embedding SRE practices (SLOs/SLIs, error budgets), IaC, and CI/CD to deliver clinical-grade reliability. Core stack: Azure OpenAI, RAG (vector/hybrid), Semantic Kernel/LangChain, Azure AI Search, Databricks/Delta/Unity Catalog, MLflow, Azure ML, AKS, GitHub Actions/Azure DevOps, Bicep/Terraform, GitOps (Flux/Argo), OPA/Azure Policy, Managed Identity/Key Vault, Azure Monitor/Grafana/Prometheus, SRE practices, Python, C#.",
    "paragraph6": "I'm open to Senior AI Engineer / Senior Data Scientist (GenAI) / Principal Engineer roles in Melbourne, where I can apply my mix of AI platform engineering + DevOps leadership to deliver impact at scale."
